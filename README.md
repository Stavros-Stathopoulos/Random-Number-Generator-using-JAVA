What is a Random Number Generator
===
Random number generation is a process by which, often by means of a random number generator (RNG), a sequence of numbers or symbols that cannot be reasonably predicted better than by random chance is generated. This means that the particular outcome sequence will contain some patterns detectable in hindsight but impossible to foresee. True random number generators can be hardware random-number generators (HRNGs), wherein each generation is a function of the current value of a physical environment's attribute that is constantly changing in a manner that is practically impossible to model. This would be in contrast to so-called "random number generations" done by pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs), which generate numbers that only look random but are in fact pre-determined—these generations can be reproduced simply by knowing the state of the PRNG.

Random Number Generator Overview
===

Our random number generator employs two distinct approaches, recognizing the inherent pseudorandom nature of such algorithms. While these generators serve various purposes, it's crucial to note that they do not meet the stringent standards required for cryptographic applications.

Observations and Analysis
===

After conducting an extensive series of 1000 iterations using the nextInt_LFSR method, a careful analysis revealed discernible patterns within the generated numbers. These patterns are graphically depicted in the accompanying diagram, offering a visual representation that underscores the existence of certain regularities.

When the data is visualized as a histogram, a noteworthy observation arises:
the probability of generating zero is significantly higher compared to other values. 
This phenomenon is further illustrated in the histograms below, emphasizing the generator's propensity to produce zero.

[Graph above, includes the Zero as a value]


Upon rerunning the method for 25 times, a pattern similar to the initial observation emerged, reinforcing the notion of a persistent pattern within the generated numbers.

Statistical Analysis of Number Distribution
=====
Upon examination of the numbers generated by our method, it becomes evident that they adhere to a uniform distribution. Leveraging this insight, we can calculate key statistical measures to better understand the characteristics of our generator.

**Average Value (Expected Value):**

$E(x)=\frac{ b+a }{2}$
​
 

Where a=0 and b=127 
(representing the lowest and highest values respectively).


$E(x)= \frac{ 127 + 0 }{2} = 63.5$

Hence, the average value returned by our generator is precisely 63.5.

**Variance:**

$Var(x) = \frac{(b - a)^2}{12}$

​
 Substituting the values  a = 0 and b = 127
$Var(x) = \frac{(127 - 0)^2}{12}  = 1344.08$

 

Therefore, the variance of the generated numbers is calculated to be 1344.08.

These statistical metrics provide a quantitative understanding of the central tendency and spread of the numbers produced by our method. This analysis lays the foundation for further refinement and optimization of our random number generation approach.





Future Development Plans
===

In our ongoing pursuit of enhanced randomness, we plan to focus on increasing the period of this pattern. This strategic adjustment aims to render the underlying pattern less conspicuous, addressing the observed regularities in a more sophisticated manner.
